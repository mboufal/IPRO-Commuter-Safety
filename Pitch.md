## Script

    *Intro*

Hello and welcome to GuidED, the application that will make your travel safer.

Here we have the demo version of the GuidED application, center to the IIT main campus it show the applications functionality and potentional. 

    *Viewing / Home Screen*

Via the home screen the user can view common points of interest such as bike racks and campus emergency buttons as well as only potential safety hassards. 

These hassards can be as simple as a patch of black ice on the side walk or as sever as a traffic accident r mugging. 

The reports are crowd sourced but the users of the application via the report feature. Sever safe incidents alert public safety officals on the admin side and recieve verification status. The report is geotagged into the system. This means that people transiting through campus no longer have to only rely on the slow public safety alert network, they can actively check the safety of their commute before the leave allowing them time to make the neccaasry adjustmets. 

    *Buddy*

Additionly verified users can use the walk buddy feature which allows the user to request a person to walk with them for safety. The buddy's are approve  by the university. 

    *911*

And finally the appliction is an citve "911" button oon the interface with means you can walk the phne in your had and help if just tap way. 

    *Potential*

 This interation of the application is meant to be used by universities tying it's cost into their Public Safety budgets and state/federla grants. However it is possible to incluse in-page advertising via the Google Ad API. This could be the cost solution when the ppliction is expanded to work on the neighborhood or city level. 





~~any potentioal safety hassards onIt's purpose is to map safety issues and points of interest on campus for transiting staff and students. ~~


~~however the application's growth potential is infinite
However this application could be refined to work on a neighborhood or city setting.~~

~~At it's very base this is a crowd source information application that allows you to see any safety incidents within your general vicinity via the live feed or the map.~~

~~No longer do staff and faculty have to solely have to rely on public safety information via the automated messaging system. The information in GuidED is crowdsourced from all of its users. This safety information is categorized and prioritized for easy viewing during the reporting process. Which means you get important safety information faster. ~~

~~A example of a low priorty incedent would be student leaveing her late night class. She keeps the GuideEd app open just in case. As she is walking through campus, she notices an area of the walkway is covered in black ice. She taps the Report button and fills out the information to report the hazard.~~

~~You may ask how does this work was quite simple. As a user you open the application
If you were walking in notice an issue such as black ice or worse a broken vehicle you can report it via the application. This information will automatically be populated onto the feed and should share issue behind a priority for the proper authorities will be contacted. As an example of a student submits a report sitting there is black ice outside of the steps of the girls in library this would be considered low priority however Maintenance may be alerted of this issue. In contrast if   you see a broken vehicle this would be considered a high priority and public safety would immediately be notified via a push notification.~~

~~After checking for any new incidents you can leave the application open on your phone as you walk as there is a conveniently placed emergency button on every page. A single tap assistance is one the way.~~

~~Additionally university students can use walk buddy. A feature that provides student a frien to walk home with form an approved list... It's like uber but for walking. Many of us have been in situations where we felt uncomfortable walking back from a late night class or studying at the library into the evening and walking home or to our car by ourselves. Walk buddy uses a network of approved university volunteers and public safety officers too. Wish upon request can be can arrive to assist you home~~~ ~~this application is meant to be used by universities tied into their Public Safety budgets hence the revenue potential's for five artists and are limited. However the standard use case of advertising on the page is possible he's in Google API.~~
