    *Intro*

Hello and welcome to GuidED, the application that will make sure you travel safely. 

Here we have the demo version of the GuidED application which is limited to the IIT main campus however the application's growth potential is infinite. It's purpose is to map safety obstructions and points of interest on campus for transiting staff and students. However this application could be refined to work on a neighborhood or city setting.

~~At it's very base this is a crowd source information application that allows you to see any safety incidents within your general vicinity via the live feed or the map.~~

    *Viewing*

No longer do staff and facutly haave to solely have to rely on safety information via the automated Public Safety messaging system. The information in GuidED is crowdsourced from all of its users. This safety information is categorized and prioritized for easy viewing during the reporting process. Which means you get important safety information faster. 

    *Reporting, levels, safety office*

~~A example of a low priorty incedent would be student leaveing her late night class. She keeps the GuideEd app open just in case. As she is walking through campus, she notices an area of the walkway is covered in black ice. She taps the Report button and fills out the information to report the hazard.~~

~~You may ask how does this work was quite simple. As a user you open the application
If you were walking in notice an issue such as black ice or worse a broken vehicle you can report it via the application. This information will automatically be populated onto the feed and should share issue behind a priority for the proper authorities will be contacted. As an example of a student submits a report sitting there is black ice outside of the steps of the girls in library this would be considered low priority however Maintenance may be alerted of this issue. In contrast if   you see a broken vehicle this would be considered a high priority and public safety would immediately be notified via a push notification.~~

    *Emergency Button*

After checking for any new incidents you can leave the application open on your phone as you walk as there is a conveniently placed emergency button on every page. A single tap assistance is one the way.

    *Walkbuddy*

Additionally university students can use walk buddy. A feature that provides student a frien to walk home with form an approved list... It's like uber but for walking. Many of us have been in situations where we felt uncomfortable walking back from a late night class or studying at the library into the evening and walking home or to our car by ourselves. Walk buddy uses a network of approved university volunteers and public safety officers too. Wish upon request can be can arrive to assist you home

    *Revenue and Growth*

 this application is meant to be used by universities tied into their Public Safety budgets hence the revenue potential's for five artists and are limited. However the standard use case of advertising on the page is possible he's in Google API.
