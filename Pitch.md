*Intro*

Hello and welcome to GuidED, the application that will make sure you transit safely. 

Here we have the demo version of the GuidED application which is limited to the Illinois Institute of Technology main campus however the application's growth potential is infinite. At it's very base this is a crowd source information application that allows you to see any safety incidents within your general vicinity via live a feed or the map. 

    *Viewing*

You no longer solely have to rely on safety information via the automated Public Safety messaging system. The information in GuidED is crowdsourced from all of its users. This information is categorized and prioritized for easy viewing after the user fill out the report. Which means you get important safety information faster. 

    *Reporting, levels, safety office*

For example; a student leaves her late night class. She keeps the GuideEd app open just in case. As she is walking through campus, she notices an area of the walkway is covered in black ice. She taps the Report button and fills out the information to report the hazard.

You may ask how does this work was quite simple. As a user you open the application
If you were walking in notice an issue such as black ice or worse a broken vehicle you can report it via the application. This information will automatically be populated onto the feed and should share issue behind a priority for the proper authorities will be contacted. As an example of a student submits a report sitting there is black ice outside of the steps of the girls in library this would be considered low priority however Maintenance may be alerted of this issue. In contrast if you see a broken vehicle this would be considered a high priority and public safety would immediately be notified via a push notification.

    *Emergency Button*

After checking for any new incidents you can leave the application open as there is a conveniently placed emergency button on every page. This button is here just in case anything happens help it's just a tap away.


oh incidents are always populated onto the feed however the public safety office has the option to remove certain incidents change the priorities and also verify/add more detail.

    *Walkbuddy*

An additional feature for university students is walk buddy. Many of us have been in situations where we felt uncomfortable walking back from a late night class or studying at the library into the evening and walking home or to our car by ourselves. Walk buddy uses a network of approved university volunteers and public safety officers too. Wish upon request can be can arrive to assist you home
