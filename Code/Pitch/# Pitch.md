*intro*

Hello and welcome to GuidED, the application that will make sure you transit safely. 

This is the demo version of the GuidED application which is limited to the Illinois Institute of Technology campus however its growth potential is infinite. At it's very base this is a crowd source information application that allows you to see any safety incidents within your general vicinity via live a feed or map. 

*Viewing*

No longer is only priorty safety information simply sent via text message or email from the office of public safety. The information in GuidED is crowdsourced from all of its users. This information is priorty categorized for easy viewing. 

*Emergency Button*

 After checking for any new incidents you can leave the application open as there is a conveniently placed emergency button on every page. This button is here just in case anything happens help it's just a tap away.

*Reporting, levels, safety office*

If you were walking in notice an issue such as black ice or worse a broken vehicle you can report it via the application. This information will automatically be populated onto the feed and should share issue behind a priority for the proper authorities will be contacted. As an example of a student submits a report sitting there is black ice outside of the steps of the girls in library this would be considered low priority however Maintenance may be alerted of this issue. In contrast if you see a broken vehicle this would be considered a high priority and public safety would immediately be notified via a push notification.

 oh incidents are always populated onto the feed however the public safety office has the option to remove certain incidents change the priorities and also verify/add more detail.

*Walkbuddy*

An additional feature for university students is walk buddy. Many of us have been in situations where we felt uncomfortable walking back from a late night class or studying at the library into the evening and walking home or to our car by ourselves. Walk buddy uses a network of approved university volunteers and public safety officers too. Wish upon request can be can arrive to assist you home

*Revenue and Growth*



______

How is this information different than the emergency alert system that many universities already provide to their students? Well this information is Crowdsourced populated by the students themselves faculty and even visitors. Priority level high incidence are monitored by the campus security which approve or deny certain incidents as well as check them out. This allows us to have more update in real time information instead of a statement email submitted two hours after an incident

Within the student version of the application there's also a feature called walk by which allows you to request a walking partner to make sure you get home safely from elite lab and evening class or just commuting weight back to campus. The bodies are pre-approved by the university they have and beautiful background check. In the bed of hers and we are relying on the universities approved list of residential advisors this is list of courses fully updated some in a similar way that Uber updates


Built on crowdsourcing technology guide allows you to view any potential safety hazards on your way home via the live incident feed for the map. Before you leave your late night class your lab order or just commuting home from work back to the dorm you can check the credit application to make sure that there haven't been any recent safety incidents in within the area. Incidents are Crowdsourced they can be added by students faculty staff public safety may have several different priorities. A student can add something as simple as 
Black ice on the sidewalk or something a little bit more troubling like a few street lights that are out when walking between buildings. Or even something a little bit more severe than this. Guide it allows you to know what incidents have happened where geographically so if you need to reroute you can.
