      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>	Walk in groups when possible; there really is protection in numbers </li>
          <li>Stay in well-lit areas and plan your route in advance </li>
          </li>Stay alert to your surroundings, with your head up, your eyes looking about, and your cell phone out of sight </li>
         <li>	Don’t stop to give directions or talk with strangers</li>
          <li>	If you think you are being followed, take evasive action by crossing to the other side of the street, changing direction, or varying your pace, and call Public Safety (or 911 if you are off campus) for help</li>
          <li>	If you have a significant concern for your safety, feel free to use the Public Safety Escort Services</li>
         <li>	Do not look at your devices while driving</li>
         <li>	On public transit:</li>
         <li>	Choose a seat near the bus driver or train conductor</li>
         <li>	Avoid isolated bus or train stops</li>
         <li>	Don’t fall asleep</li>
        	<li> your belongings on your lap</li>
         <li>	Be prepared, and know the schedules and the route you are taking</li>
         <li>	If you are traveling off campus—especially if you are walking—use the Safety Timers feature on the Rave Guardian app to let someone know when you leave, where you are going, and when you expect to arrive.</li>
          <li>	Get to know your Public Safety officers. They are here for you, so don’t hesitate to say hello.</li>
         <li>	Look around for emergency call stations around campus, so you are familiar with where they are.</li>
         <li>	Visit the Public Safety website, Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram page for helpful information, including information about on- and off-campus public safety escorts.</li>
         <li>	Program the emergency number 312.808.6363 for Illinois Tech’s Public Safety into your phone.</li>
         <li>	And, once again, register your mobile number in IIT Alert.</li>
