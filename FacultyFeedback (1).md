# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##

- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 2 - Jan 18 ##

## Week 3 - Jan 25 ##

## Week 4 - Feb 1 ##

- Working agreement needs list of SCRUM lead and dates
- Next week each person will present for 30 seconds on what they completed and what they are working on now
- In order to get the velocity you need by mobbing you would have to close one story every 30 minutes during class. You have to divide up the work and work independently during class. Each person should have a separate story to work on during class
